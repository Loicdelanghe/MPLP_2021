In class we saw the very useful Set() command which can remove duplicates from a list. Can you write a python script  that does the same? 


Dodona will automatically provide input lists for your script. However since Dodona is quite particular when it comes to input and evaluation of python scripts you should start your script with:


<pre><code>
Duplicates_list = eval(input())
</code></pre>

You can then write your python code for removing duplicates from the list called Duplicates_list. At the end of your script, print out the new list without the duplicate entries

### Example

**Invoer:**

    [7, "Strawberry", "Banana", "Apple", "banana", "Apple", 1, "Melon", 7]

**Uitvoer:**

    [7, "Strawberry", "Banana", "Apple", "banana", 1, "Melon"]
