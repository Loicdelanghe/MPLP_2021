As happens very often, we make mistakes and Python raises errors. Read the following block of code and correct all the errors (there are many!). The final result should be **Marie and Joseph have two children, Bert and An. Between the two children there is a difference of age of 3 years.** In this exercise, use the concatenation method of creating complex strings, not the f-strings method.


<pre><code>
child1 = 'Bert'
child2 = 'An'
age_child1 = '5'
age_child2 = '2'

mother = Marie
father = Joseph

message1 = mother 'and' father 'have two children, ' child1 and child2. 
message2 = 'Between the two children there is a difference of age of ' (age_child1 - age_child2) 'years.'
print(message1 + message2)

</code></pre>

For this exercise, write the corrected version of the code in the fields below.
