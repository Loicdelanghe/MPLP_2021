Did you know you can make art using simple python commands (or any programming language for that matter)? Many talented people on the internet are making what is called "ASCII art" and in this exercise you will be doing something similar. 

Write a Python script that prints out the joined X's (as seen below) based on an input number. The number of joined X's should be equal to the input number (so if the input is 3, your program should print 3 joined X's). 

<pre><code>
*     *
 *   * 
   *
 *   *
*     *

</code></pre>

Dodona will automatically provide input numbers for your script. However since Dodona is quite particular when it comes to input and evaluation of python scripts you should start your script with:

<pre><code>
X_number = eval(input())
</code></pre>

You can then write your python code for printing the joined X's. 

### Example

**Input:**

    2

**Output:**

    *     *
     *   * 
       *
     *   *
    *     *
    *     *
     *   * 
       *
     *   *
    *     *
