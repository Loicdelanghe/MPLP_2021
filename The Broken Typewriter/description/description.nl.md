Old typewriters would sometimes get things mixed up, resulting into unintellegible text. Luckily we have technology to take care of that now. For this excercise consider a broken typewriter that prints a 7 whenever the letter "l" is typed and the symbol $ when it should print the letter "r".  Write a python script that takes as input the text produced by the broken typewriter and turns it back into readable text. Dodona will automatically input strings produced by the typewriter so you can start your code of with:

<pre><code>
broken_typewriter_text = input()

</code></pre>

Your script should print out the corrected text at the end.
