In class we saw the set() command, a useful tool for when you are trying to remove duplicates from a Python list. Can you write a program that does the same, without using the set() command?

### Input

A list that contains some duplicate entries

<pre><code>
let a = 5;
let b = 42;
</code></pre>

### Output

The "cleaned" input list

### Example

**Input:**

    ["apple", "orange", "blueberry", "apple", "pear", "blueberry"]

**Output:**

    ["apple", "orange", "blueberry", "pear"]
